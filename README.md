This repository demonstrates a common error when using Firebase: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in an 'Unhandled Promise Rejection: Cannot read properties of undefined' error.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes async/await to correctly handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase data retrieval.
